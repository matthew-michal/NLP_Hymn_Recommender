0,60, I'll Praise My Maker While I've Breath," I'll praise my Maker while I've breath;
and when my voice is lost in death,
praise shall employ my nobler powers.
My days of praise shall ne'er be past,
while life, and thought, and being last,
or immortality endures. Happy are they whose hopes rely
on Israel's God, who made the sky
and earth and seas, with all their train;
whose truth for ever stands secure,
who saves th'oppressed and feeds the poor,
for none shall find God's promise vain. The Lord pours eyesight on the blind;
the Lord supports the fainting mind
and sends the laboring conscience peace.
God helps the stranger in distress,
the widow and the fatherless,
and grants the prisoner sweet release. I'll praise my God who lends me breath;
and when my voice is lost in death,
praise shall employ my nobler powers.
My days of praise shall ne'er be past,
while life, and thought, and being last,
or immortality endures."

his mercy is forever sure;
his truth at all times firmly stood,
and shall from age to age endure."

86,110, A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,". A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing;
our helper he amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.. Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right man on our side,
the man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is he;
Lord Sabaoth, his name,
from age to age the same,
and he must win the battle.. And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God hath willed
his truth to triumph through us.
The Prince of Darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
for lo, his doom is sure;
one little word shall fell him.. That word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, abideth;
the Spirit and the gifts are ours,
thru him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill;
God's truth abideth still;
his kingdom is forever."
87,110,,
88,111, How Can We Name a Love," How can we name a Love
that wakens heart and mind,
indwelling all we know
or think or do
or seek or find?
Within our daily world,
in every human face,
Love's echoes sound
and God is found,
hid in the commonplace. If we awoke to life
built on a rock of care
that asked no great reward
but firm, assured,
was simply there,
we can, with parents' names,
describe, and thus adore,
Love unconfined,
a father kind,
a mother strong and sure. When people share a task,
and strength and skills unite
in projects old or new,
to make or do
with shared delight,
our Friend and Partner's will
is better understood,
that all should share,
create, and care,
and know that life is good. So in a hundred names,
each day we all can meet
a presence, sensed and shown
at work, at home,
or in the street.
Yet every name we see,
shines in a brighter sun:
In Christ alone
is Love full grown
and life and hope begun."

our hope for years to come,
our shelter from the stormy blast,
and our eternal home!. Under the shadow of thy throne,
still may we dwell secure;
sufficient is thine arm alone,
and our defense is sure.. Before the hills in order stood,
or earth received her frame,
from everlasting, thou art God,
to endless years the same.. A thousand ages, in thy sight,
are like an evening gone;
short as the watch that ends the night,
before the rising sun.. Time, like an ever rolling stream,
bears all who breathe away;
they fly forgotten, as a dream
dies at the opening day.. O God, our help in ages past,
our hope for years to come;

98,118, The Care the Eagle Gives Her Young," The care the eagle gives her young, safe in her lofty nest,
is like the tender love of God for us made manifest. As when the time to venture comes, she stirs them out to flight,
so we are pressed to boldly try, to strive for daring height. And if we flutter helplessly, as fledgling eagles fall,
beneath us lift God's mighty wings to bear us, one and all."

388,293, Behold the Savior of Mankind," Behold the Savior of mankind
nailed to the shameful tree;
how vast the love that him inclined
to bleed and die for thee! Hark how he groans! while nature shakes,
and earth's strong pillars bend!
The temple's veil in sunder breaks,
the solid marbles rend. 'Tis done! the precious ransom's paid!
""Receive my soul!"" he cries;
see where he bows his sacred head!
He bows his head and dies! But soon he'll break death's envious chain
and in full glory shine.
O Lamb of God, was ever pain,
was ever love like thine?"

and did my Sovereign die?
Would he devote that sacred head
for sinners such as I?. Was it for crimes that I have done,
he groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!. Well might the sun in darkness hide,
and shut its glories in,
when God, the mighty maker, died
for his own creature's sin.. Thus might I hide my blushing face
while his dear cross appears;
dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
and melt mine eyes to tears.. But drops of tears can ne'er repay
the debt of love I owe.
Here, Lord, I give myself away;
'tis all that I can do."

Lo! it glows with peace and joy.. When the sun of bliss is beaming
light and love upon my way,
from the cross the radiance streaming
adds more luster to the day.. Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
by the cross are sanctified;
peace is there that knows no measure,
joys that through all time abide.. In the cross of Christ I glory,

tell how Christ, the world's Redeemer,
as a victim won the day.. Tell how, when at length the fullness
of th' appointed time was come,
Christ, the Word, was born of woman,
left for us his heavenly home;
showed us human life made perfect,
shone as light amid the gloom.. Thus, with thirty years accomplished,
went he forth from Nazareth,
destined, dedicated, willing,
wrought his work, and met his death.
Like a lamb he humbly yielded
on the cross his dying breath.. Faithful cross, thou sign of triumph,
now for us the noblest tree,
none in foliage, none in blossom,
none in fruit thy peer may be;
symbol of the world's redemption,
for the weight that hung on thee!. Unto God be praise and glory:
to the Father and the Son,
to th' eternal Spirit honor
now and evermore be done;
praise and glory in the highest,
while unending ages run."

and the burden of the day.. Upon that cross of Jesus
mine eye at times can see
the very dying form of One
who suffered there for me;
and from my stricken heart with tears
two wonders I confess:
the wonders of redeeming love
and my unworthiness.. I take, O cross, thy shadow
for my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
the sunshine of his face;
content to let the world go by,
to know no gain nor loss,
my sinful self my only shame,
my glory all the cross."

save in the death of Christ, my God;

I sacrifice them to his blood.. See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
sorrow and love flow mingled down.
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
or thorns compose so rich a crown?. Were the whole realm of nature mine,
that were an offering far too small;
love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all."

the Majesty on high.. Prayer is the contrite sinners' voice,
returning from their way,
while angels in their songs rejoice
and cry, ""Behold, they pray!"". Prayer is the Christians' vital breath,
the Christians' native air;
their watchword at the gates of death;
they enter heaven with prayer.. O Thou, by whom we come to God,
the Life, the Truth, the Way:
the path of prayer thyself hast trod;
Lord, teach us how to pray!"

shakes the trembling gates of hell. Saints of God, your Savior praise,
who the door hath opened wide;
he hath given the word of grace,
Jesus’ word is glorified;
Jesus mighty to redeem,
who alone the work hath wrought;
worthy is the work of him,
him who spake a world from naught. Saw ye not the cloud arise,

that shall not weep again. Hark, how from men whose lives are held
more cheap than merchandise,
from women struggling sore for bread,
from little children's cries,
there swells the sobbing human plaint
that bids thy walls arise. O shame to us who rest content
while lust and greed for gain
in street and shop and tenement
wring gold from human pain,
and bitter lips in blind despair
cry “Christ hath died in vain!” Give us, O God, the strength to build
the city that hath stood
too long a dream, whose laws are love,
whose crown is servanthood,
and where the sun that shineth is
God’s grace for human good. Already in the mind of God

while for thy grace, Lord, their voices of praise
thy blessed people eternally raise.. Now, in the meanwhile, with hearts raised on high,
we for that country must yearn and must sigh;
seeking Jerusalem, dear native land,

which God gives us when we pray.. Blest inhabitants of Zion,
